#section for the Tracer
[Tracer]
	##The system log files are generated by the Tracer to include
	##information about all the activities made by the process.
	##It generates one new log files when the current log file reaches
	##a specific size or after a specified period.
	##Since we have many files generated by the process,
	##this parameter indicates the base trace file name
	##(REMARK: THIS IS NOT A DIRECTORY BUT IT'S A PATH FILE NAME.
	##YOU DON'T HAVE TO CREATE IT);
	##the specific trace file name is obtained concatenating to this parameter a sequential number.
	##On linux/unix environment remember to use '/' as directory separator
	##instead of '\' that is used for Windows platforms.
	##BaseTraceFileName = D:\app\ServiceBroker\logs\SystemLogs\SystemLogs
	##BaseTraceFileName = /app/ServiceBroker/logs/SystemLogs/SystemLogs
	BaseTraceFileName = /home/dev/giuliano/tmp/7/DevelopmentWorkingArea/CatraLibraries/examples/Socket/tracerServer/tmp/Tracer

	##This parameter is the max size in K-bytes that a trace file can reach.
	##Once the trace file reaches that specific size, the Tracer will generate a new trace file.
	##Default is 10000
	MaxTraceFileSize = 10000

	##This parameter is the period in seconds after that
	##the Tracer will generate a new trace file.
	##Default: 86400 (1 day)
	TraceFilePeriodInSecs = 86400

	##The parameter indicates if the Tracer must compress the trace file once
	##it is completed. It is suggested to set this flag to 'false' if the
	##the SB has to manage a big peak of requests
	##Default is false.
	CompressedTraceFile = false

	##The Tracer will generate a new trace file each time
	##a specific trace size or period is reached.
	##This parameter indicates the max number of trace files the Logs Repository must have.
	##One this number is reached, the Tracer deletes the oldest trace file.
	##Default is 500
	TraceFilesNumberToMaintain = 500

	##The Tracer writes always every trace on the trace file. If this parameter is initialized
	##to true, every trace is written also to the standard output.
	##Default is false.
	TraceOnTTY = true

	##The Tracer does not write the traces directly into the trace file,
	##but it uses a cache for performance reason.
	##This parameter represents the size in K-byte of this cache.
	##If CacheSizeOfTraceFile is initialized to -1, the cache will
	##not be used and the traces will be flushed as they are
	##added to the Tracer
	##Default is 1000.
	CacheSizeOfTraceFile = -1

	##The quantity of information you have inside the trace files is determined
	##from the trace level indicated by this parameter.
	##The trace level can be initialized to one of the following values:
	##LDBG1
	##LDBG2
	##LDBG3
	##LDBG4
	##LDBG5
	##LDBG6
	##LINFO
	##LMESG
	##LWRNG
	##LERRR
	##LFTAL.
	##Default is LDBG6.
	TraceLevel = LDBG5

	##The Tracer can change dynamically his configuration
	##(any parameter specified inside this section) without stopping
	##the process but just sending a specified command through a socket.
	##This parameter specifies the socket port where the System Tracer will listen.
	##Default: 6010
	ListenTracePort = 9010
