===================

Before trying to compile the CatraLibraries make sure you have installed the
following software packages:

   o gnu make version 3.7 or newer (required)
   o gcc compiler and library (required). We recommend gcc 3.4.2 or newer
   o flex 2.5.2 or newer (optional)
   o bison 1.22 or newer (optional)

flex and bison are only necessary if you change their input files
(files having the suffix .ll and .yy).


Prerequisits - Win32 (Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP)
==================================================

	o Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler 7.0
	o pthreads-dll-2005-03-08 library
		download the pthreads-dll-2005-01-25 directory
			from ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32.
			(the site is http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32)
		Create the link pthreads-dll (must be brother
			of the catralibraries directory) to pthreads-dll-2005-01-25
	o flex 2.5.2 or newer (optional)
