      The entries in a crontab file are lines of six fields each.  The
      fields are separated by spaces or tabs.  The lines have the following
      format:

           minute  hour  monthday  month  weekday  command

      The first five are integer patterns that specify when the sixth field,
      command, should be executed.  They can have the following ranges of
      values:

           minute         The minute of the hour, 0-59

           hour           The hour of the day, 0-23

           monthday       The day of the month, 1-31

           month          The month of the year, 1-12

           weekday        The day of the week, 0-6, 0=Sunday

      Each pattern can be either an asterisk (*), meaning all legal values,
      or a list of elements separated by commas.  An element is either a
      number in the ranges shown above, or two numbers in the range
      separated by a hyphen (meaning an inclusive range).  Note that the
      specification of days can be made in two fields: monthday and weekday.
      If both are specified in an entry, they are cumulative.  For example,

           0   0   1,15   *   1   command

      runs command at midnight on the first and fifteenth of each month, as
      well as every Monday.  To specify days in only one field, set the
      other field to asterisk (*).  For example,

           0   0   *   *   1   command

      runs command only on Mondays.
